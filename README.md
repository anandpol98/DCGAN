# DCGAN
Deep Convulational Generarive Adversarial Networks are comparatively stable GAN's while training compared to Normal GAN. In this implementation, DCGAN is trained over MNIST digit Dataset for over 10,000 epochs, after training model tries to generate dataset similar to MNIST, which can be seen at the end. Results are quite satisfactory and visually appealing.
